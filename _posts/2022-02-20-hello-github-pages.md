Things that have been on my mind for ages:

* Overhaul of my main Projects site? <i class="em em-heavy_check_mark" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HEAVY CHECK MARK"></i>  
* Update of various projects? <i class="em em-heavy_check_mark" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HEAVY CHECK MARK"></i>
* Consolidate some of my microsites? <i class="em em-heavy_check_mark" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HEAVY CHECK MARK"></i>

I finally got around to these in the past month or so.

New subdomain URL for this Projects site: **https://projects.possiblyzebra.net/**

I was playing around with GitHub Pages, and realised the theme I was trying out, [So Simple by Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme), was really kind of perfect for my Projects site.

I also didn't really need the GitHub Pages subdomain - well, I don't really need most of my microsites, I just like hoarding them, haha. But in this case knowing the features of GitHub Pages, it made sense to use it to power my Projects site.
