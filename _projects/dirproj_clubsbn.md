**Technically a dead project**

This was an idea I had prior to the Brunei Facebook explosion of the [], that there existed several clubs, associations and communities in Brunei, and several of these actually had active online presence.

I thought these could be listed in a directory of sorts, and make it easier for others to find.

## Version 1: dir.proj.list

Fancy name eh. Yeah, brought to you by the person who went on to be a co-founder of B:Read.

## Version 2: Clubs BN

Leftovers - Here is a list of the links I had compiled by the time I was doing Clubs BN. They will undoubtedly be outdated by the time you are looking at it, but it would serve as an example of what I was trying to achieve.
