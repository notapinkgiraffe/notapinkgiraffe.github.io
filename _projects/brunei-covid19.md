## About

### Overview

Database of current, as well as previous, Brunei Cabinet members (Ministers, Deputy Ministers, and positions with Ministerial Ranks). 
Also includes Permanent Secretaries and Deputy Permanent Secretaries.

Does not currently include Legislative Council members - I am considering this.

What is recorded:

* Appointment details (Date started, date ended, references)
* Person details (Name, age, background, photo) - _Publicly available information only_

### Not a Feature: <u>Titles & Hierarchies</u>

Apologies that the titles of individuals ~~and the appropriate ~~hierarchies of Ministries~~ \* may not be 
shown correctly. This is not meant to offend, it's to make the database simpler to manage.

\* - _As of Jan 2018, Ministry hierarchy has been added (and is hopefully working)_

### Features: <u>Database Views</u>

You can view the **Current Cabinet**:

<a class="button btn80px" href="https://airtable.com/shrmqBAoPH5rhwWBj/tblR9UtkFralfbHvy">View Gallery</a> Cabinet Ministers only  
<a class="button btn80px" href="https://airtable.com/shro4B3NhGBfkwKOG">View List</a> All including PermSecs

The database is meant to be a reference to current and past appointments. Other than that, I also thought it would be useful to have 
certain kinds of information (i.e. database views/queries) about Brunei senior government appointments, such as...

* [Gallery of women appointed (Current)](https://airtable.com/shrwrDNEJ8Zb11z8c)  
* [List of women appointed (Current & Past)](https://airtable.com/shrOGuC4eU2pU9f38)  
* [Age at appointment](https://airtable.com/shrICwXbjtpjZww8h)
* [Length of current appointments](https://airtable.com/shrB1Msu7dw2nMb0z)
* History of appointments in a Ministry (e.g. PMO)  
* History of appointments for a person

### Contribute!

Currently, I've collected appointments during the 2010-2015 and 2015-2010 periods. There are still many gaps that 
I try to update in my spare time.

If you'd like to help contribute, I'd greatly appreciate it! (Crowdsourcing is A++, guys)

## Background

### Iterations

#### Part 1: Spreadsheet

To keep track of 'who replaced who' in the 2015 Brunei Cabinet reshuffle, I started a **spreadsheet** on Google Sheets.
I ended up also tracking appointments of Permanent Secretaries and their Deputies. The further back 
I dug, the larger the spreadsheet became.

* Status: **Retired**. Spreadsheet remains online but will not be updated.  
* Visit Spreadsheet: http://goo.gl/upuDCH

#### Part 2: Database

The spreadsheet got unwieldy, so when I discovered Airtable, I experimented with the data in a database format. 
I liked it so much that I ended up transferring it over from the spreadsheet to the database. 
(Databases are a lot of fun.)

* Status: **Current**  
* Visit Database: http://bit.ly/brucabinet_base

### Inspirations

It's worth mentioning that although [SiapaKedia](http://siapakedia.com.bn/) by BAG Networks was not a direct inspiration for this project, I had used it occasionally as a resource for checking appointments and "who's who" of senior government officials. It was pretty thorough!

When I created my spreadsheet, SiapaKedia had already started to be inactive. I decided to make my spreadsheet that would fit my specific interest, i.e. a resource that would show me who had been transferred, promoted, and so on.
