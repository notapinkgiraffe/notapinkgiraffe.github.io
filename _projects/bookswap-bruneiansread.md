Project intro.

## Test

* Year: 2009 - 2011
* Status: {{ page.proj_status }}

<!-- Now known as **B:Read Bookswap** under B:Read (Bruneians Read).

It started out as a group on Facebook, although it was largely inactive until 2011.  I started up B:Read separately with Teah, Nazmi and Faiq, and after the first bookswap event held in [Nov 2011] it was decided to take in the bookswaps under B:Read.

Our bookswaps are now an annual event and B:Read has also grown with a sweet cast of committee members and volunteers. We also do lots of other things to encourage reading in Brunei, which you can check out on the [B:Read website].

The bookswap group on Facebook, still alive and hopefully well, [can be found here].
