Text: When devising the map for a [Brunei-Muara Metro/MRT], Faiq Airudin and I decided to give it a home. Together with the [H's name], this was meant to be a place for our Brunei projects, with an interest in essays and data, and open to contributions. I've talked more about it [in this ProjekBrunei interview with Kathrina Daud].
